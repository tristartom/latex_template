writing paper: 
first write paper then summarize into slides.
-free mind when writing paper. slides give constraints.

trivial problem? 
-one sentense to introduce the idea! no hierarchy.
-don't put responsibility of introducing concept to other places.

how to abstract?
-first concrete, down-to-earth idea with plain language, 
-dont abstract before you are $100\%$ sure about the correctness of the concrete stuff.

need some concept, no time to introduce in detail?
-dont put the burden to somewhere before
-one sentense to quick intro, reader has to connect by imagination.

style to be down-to-earth (f\_paperRview\_arun):
-mention it when you can fix all possible problems, raised. if you can't, don't mention it, even...
